**Privacy issues in public Wi-Fi networks (hotspots)**
-

The objective of this project is to develop methods and techniques that will allow us to (i) detect privacy leakage in public Wi-Fi networks from different sources, e.g., leakage from user behaviors (e.g., browsing, apps usage), leakage from third party advertisers; (ii) perform empirical measurements of leakage and compare (some) hotspot providers across Montreal in terms of privacy-friendliness; and (iii) customize or package existing tools (and possibly create an app if appropriate) for investigation which data is currently being collected by hotspots, primarily to be used by researchers. 

In addition to the developed tool(s),  make sure to record your analysis steps, methodologies, and results, and produce a detailed  "Report Card"  that can be disseminated in a quick overview format (with a letter grade assigned to each examined hotspot  with respect to each investigated category, targeted for end users and policy makers)
